# 2025SE-Gianfranco.Manieli-Toucher

Year 11 Mechatronics Project

Our mechatronics' core function is to pick out 3 different colored cubes and sort them. This is via use of ultrasonic sensors, an RGB color sensor and multiple servos. 

The Toucher has many features, including: 
    Color detection, distance detection, algorithms to manage claw functions (grip, release, movement of claw itself)  
    Our design incorporates these features in a way that effectively allows the user to pick and sort different colored cubes using our algorithms.
